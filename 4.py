#1 2
#In summary, the code unpacks the keys of the `roman` dictionary
# into variables `d` and `r`, resulting in `d` containing `1` and `r` containing `2`, and then it prints these values. 
# The values associated with the keys in the dictionary (i.e., 'i' and 'ii') are ignored during the unpacking.
